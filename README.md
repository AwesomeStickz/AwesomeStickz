Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Awesome Stickz, a self-taught Developer (obviously with the help of various online communities)

I know a few programming languages but I only code in TypeScript cuz why not

I'm better at backend compared to I'm at frontend but I can do full stack since I'm already doing it, all with TypeScript

I'm currently working on [Giveaway Boat](https://giveaway.boats/) â›µ, an advanced Discord giveaway bot owned by me, used by over 100,000+ servers
