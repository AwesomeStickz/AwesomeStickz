Hi 👋

I'm Awesome Stickz, a 19 yo self-taught Developer (obviously with the help of various online communities)

I mainly love coding 👩‍💻 but I play games 🎮 and watch animes when I'm free 🆓

I know a few programming languages but I only code in TypeScript cuz why not

I'm better at backend compared to I'm at frontend but I can do full stack since I'm already doing it, all with TypeScript

I'm currently working on [Giveaway Boat](https://giveawayboat.com/) ⛵, an advanced Discord giveaway bot owned by me, used by over 25,000 servers

Oh and btw, I do have a real life. I go by the name Ravi Kiran irl which I don't really use much online tbh
